### Hi there 👋  

I'm a current graduate student studying data science at MIT.  

I come from a Neuroscience and Biology background from UNC-Chapel Hill 🐏, so I am interested in applications of machine learning that help improve patient outcomes!  

Some of the projects I have worked on include:  
🚑 Optimizing inter-hospital patient transfer routing (Python/Julia, partner Rachit Jain)  
💊 Finding patient subpopulations that respond exceptionally well to a particular treatment for biliary cirrhosis (Julia, partner Guillaume Bonheure)  

Feel free to check out my portfolio as well as my web dashboard for visualizing the optimal patient transfer routes we found.
