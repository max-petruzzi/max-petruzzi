### Hi there 👋  

I'm a current graduate student studying data science at MIT.  

I come from a Neuroscience and Biology background from UNC-Chapel Hill 🐏, so I am interested in applications of machine learning and AI that help improve patient outcomes!  

Some of the projects I have worked on include:  
[💊](https://github.com/max-petruzzi/ML-Exceptional-Drug-Responders-Project) Finding patient subpopulations that respond exceptionally well to a particular treatment for biliary cirrhosis (Julia, partner Guillaume Bonheure)
[🚑](https://github.com/rachit-0032/Patient-Transfer-Optimization) Optimizing inter-hospital patient transfer routing (Python/Julia, partner Rachit Jain)  
[🏥](https://github.com/alexandreberkovic/Analytics-Edge) Making interpretable time-series predictions of COVID-19 impact based on staffing shortages and hospital overcapacity (R/Python, partners Alexandre Berkovic, Sri Reddy, Osho Yonzon)

Feel free to check out my portfolio as well as my [web dashboard](https://max-petruzzi.github.io/) for visualizing the optimal patient transfer routes we found.
