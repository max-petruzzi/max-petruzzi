### Hi there 👋  

I'm a current graduate student studying data science at MIT.  

I come from a Neuroscience and Biology background from UNC-Chapel Hill 🐏, so I am interested in applications of machine learning and AI that help improve patient outcomes and bring life-saving therapeutics to market!  

#### Some of the life sciences or healthcare projects I have worked on include: 
💊 Finding patient subpopulations that respond exceptionally well to a particular treatment for biliary cirrhosis (Julia, partner Guillaume Bonheure) [[link]](https://github.com/max-petruzzi/ML-Exceptional-Drug-Responders-Project)  
🚑 Optimizing inter-hospital patient transfer routing (Python/Julia, partner Rachit Jain) [[link]](https://github.com/rachit-0032/Patient-Transfer-Optimization)  
🏥 Making interpretable time-series predictions of COVID-19 impact based on staffing shortages and hospital overcapacity (R/Python, partners Alexandre Berkovic, Sri Reddy, Osho Yonzon) [[link]](https://github.com/alexandreberkovic/Analytics-Edge)

#### I have also worked on projects in other domain areas, including:
📱 1<sup>st</sup> place McKinsey Digital Hackathon winner -- a collaboration with Code.org, built a mobile application to help bring coding education to developing countries. Utilized the power of OpenAI and YouTube APIs to give students and teachers real-time feedback on their verbal explanations of coding concepts (Python/Javascript, partners Mihir Dhamankar, Joanna Kennedy, and Weizhe Zhao) [[link]](https://github.com/max-petruzzi/McK_Hack)  
🚢 A collaboration with CMA CGM, the world's third-largest shipping company, to automatically predict no-action emails and thus improve the operational efficiency of their customer support team (Python, partners Victor Radermecker, Andrea Zanon, Guillaume Bonheure) [[link]](https://github.com/victor-radermecker/AnalyticsLab_Project)

Feel free to check out my portfolio as well as my [web dashboard](https://max-petruzzi.github.io/) for visualizing the optimal patient transfer routes we found.
